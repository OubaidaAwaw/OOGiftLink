# OOGiftLink

**OOGiftLink** is a full-stack web application designed for users to give away household items they no longer need and find items they want to recycle. The platform connects people who wish to share their goods with those looking for free, pre-owned items. Built with the MERN stack, OOGiftLink offers a seamless experience for users to register, log in, browse listings, and manage their profiles.

## Project Overview

This project was developed as part of a Coursera Capstone course. The goal was to create a full-stack web application with both a client-side React interface and a server-side Node.js backend, utilizing MongoDB for data storage and Express.js for API routes. The application features user authentication, secure login, and an intuitive interface for browsing and managing household items.

## Features

- **User Registration & Authentication**: Secure login and registration system.
- **Item Listings**: View, add, and edit items for donation or exchange.
- **Search & Filter**: Easily search for items based on categories and user preferences.
- **Profile Management**: Users can manage their personal information and listings.
- **Responsive Design**: Optimized for both desktop and mobile devices.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: React, Vite, React Router, Redux, React-Redux
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express.js
- **Database**: MongoDB
- **Authentication**: JSON Web Token (JWT)
- **File Upload**: Multer
- **Security**: Helmet, CORS, Express-Validator, Bcryptjs
